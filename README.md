By Joshua Fairchild, August 2017 - Epicodus Capstone Project

## Description
Strain Scout is an application that provides an easy to use interface for browsing cannabis strains and getting an overview of information about specific strains. Currently the application allows users to search for strains by name and then view a details page containing the strain's genetics, geographic lineage, effects, and terpene flavors. Future plans for the project include:
* Allowing a user to view more information about the genetic parents of a given strain.
* Provide users with an option to search for strains based off of parameters (effects, flavors, location, seed company, etc) rather than name alone.
* Provide a user with a list of reviews for the strain that they are viewing.
* Add a section to a strain's details overview that contains information about the seed company that produces the strain.
